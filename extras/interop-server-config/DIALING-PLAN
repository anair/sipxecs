This directory contains the configuration for the interoperability test server,
interop.pingtel.com.

The subdirectories are:

sipx_confdir
   Configuration files to be unpacked into /etc/sipxpbx after a standard
   sipX installation.

scripts
   Scripts that are run as cron jobs, and the crontab file that run them.

   HTML files to be unpacked into /usr/share/www/doc for the custom web interface.

sipx_dbdir
   Customized configuration databases to be put in /var/sipxdata/sipdb.

The current number assignments are as follows.  "gg" is the group
number, from 00 to 99.  (index.html claims only 10..99 as groups, but
we may need the single-digit groups as well.)  "n" is used here to mean
1 through 9, to shorten the table.
