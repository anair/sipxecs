/// Implement an HTTP server interface.
/**
 * This class listens on the accept socket passed to the constructor, accepting new
 * connections and creating an HttpConnection object for each.  If the constructor
 * specified that connections should be persistent, the HttpServer maintains the list
 * of open connections and enforces the MAX_PERSISTENT_HTTP_CONNECTIONS limit.
 *
 * Actual HTTP requests are parsed from the HttpConnection by HttpMessage::read,
 * and then the HttpConnection object passes them to HttpServer::processRequest.
 *
 * Prior to attempting to process the request itself, the HttpServer:
 *
 * - Optionally enforces any restrictions on the remote IP address.  If the validIpAddressDB
 *   parameter passed to the HttpServer constructor is non-NULL and not empty, then the
 *   IP address of the requestor must appear in that database, or the request is rejected
 *   with a 403 Forbidden response.
 *
 *   IP addresses are NOT a good authentication mechanism.  See HttpRequestContext for
 *   a description of how to use TLS peer authentication for strong authentication.
 *
 * - Path is checked for any '..' elements and rejected if they are present.
 *
 * - Applies any mappings configured using addUriMap (see addUriMap and mapUri).
 *
 * - Constructs an HttpRequestContext object to provide all the information about the request.
 * 
 * There are three ways to handle an HTTP request; the mapped path is used select the
 * processor for the request from among these method in this order (At present, this resolution
 * is applied only to GET and POST methods):
 *
 * -# Create a static method whose signature matches HttpServer::RequestProcessor and
 *    register the method using addRequestProcessor.  This means of providing an HTTP
 *    service is relatively simple, but provides no context except the request itself.
 *    Using this method, you must specify the exacty path that this processor is
 *    is responsible for.
 *
 * -# Create a subclass of HttpService and register an object of that class using addHttpService.
 *    The registered object will be called using its version of HttpService::processRequest,
 *    passed the request, an empty response, and the HttpRequestContext.
 *    Using this method, the service is responsible for any extension of the registered
 *    path (see addHttpService).
 *    This means of providing a service is best when you need additional contextual
 *    information in the service object or want to use additional path information.
 *    
 * -# A simple built-in file access service can be enabled by calling allowFileAccess
 *    (this is disabled by default).  The built-in service does not do any authentication
 *    beyond the IP optional address validation step described above.
 *    USE OF THE THIS IS NOT RECOMMENDED.
