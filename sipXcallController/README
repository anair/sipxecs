Third party call controller
===========================

This is the RESTLET based third party call controller.

Currently we only support REFER based third party call control. 
INVITE based third party call control may be supported if there 
is a requirement to stay in the call path and monitor call progress.

REFER based third party call control
=====================================
REFER based third party call control is "Fire and Forget"
The call is placed and subsequently, the third party call controller is not in the call path.

There are three parties involved :

The agent that initiates the call. This is the last part of the URL. The callController masquerades as the agent.
The calling party to which the call is initially placed. This is the callingParty parameter
The called party to which the call is REFERRed. This is the calledParty parameter.

An alias may be used anywhere a SIP user name is used.

The call controller consults etc/sipxpbx/validusers.xml to authenticate users and map user aliases to user names.

The general form of the URL is

https://host:6666/callcontroller/refer/agentName?callingParty=callingPartyName&calledParty=calledPartyName&pin=pin

You dont need a pin to invoke it from within the sipx domain. You can specify user name or user alias for agentName, 
callingParty or calledParty.

You dont need to specify the pin when calling this service from within the sipx domain. When the callingParty is 
not specified, it is assumed to be the same as the agent. The calledParty parameter is mandatory.

callingParty and calledParty can be a foreign domain ( for example you would want to do that for calls directed to an ITSP ).
If you do not specify a full address (i.e. name@domain), the domain is assumed to be the sipx domain.
agentName must have a PBX account (for authentication purposes ). 
If you do not specify a callingParty this is assumed to be the same as the agent.

For example within the sipx domain, the URL can look like this:
https://sipxpbx.sipxtest.net:6666/callcontroller/refer/201?callingParty=201&calledParty=202

This is equivalent to 
https://sipxpbx.sipxtest.net:6666/callcontroller/refer/201?calledParty=202

Here 201 can be either the user name or the alias of a user.
It is is both the agent placing the call as well as the calling party.

To invoke this from outside the sipx domain :
https://sipxpbx.sipxtest.net:6666/callcontroller/refer/201?calledParty=202&pin=123

Other optional URL parameters:

subject  - this URL parameter determines what goes into the SIP subject header of the initial call setup INVITE.
