"syslogviewer" is a simple program to reformat sipX log file lines
into a more easily readable format.

Normally, syslogviewer is in the SIPX_BINDIR directory.  Its arguments
are:

Usage:
        syslogviewer [-h | --help] [-i | --indent] [-f[nn]]
                     [of=output]
                     [input]


        --help  Print this help message.
        --indent        Indent messages and continued lines.
        -f[nn]  Fold lines that are over nn (default 80) characters.
                Implies --indent.
        if=     Specify input file name (deprecated - use file name directly).
        of=     Specify output file name.
        input - input file name.

Its basic operation is to locate "\n" in the log file lines and turn
them into newlines, thus formatting SIP messages line they appear on
the line.  "\r" combinations are deleted entirely.

If "-i" is specified, after the line breaks, the next line is indented
with a tab character.

If "-f" is specified, lines that occupy over 80 columns will be
broken.  "-fNN" specifies a line length of NN columns rather than 80.
The latter parts of broken lines will each be indented 4 spaces.  If
"-i" is specified also, the leading tabs it generates will be counted
as 8 columns, and a tabbed line that is broken will be indented 8
columns (one tab and 4 spaces).
