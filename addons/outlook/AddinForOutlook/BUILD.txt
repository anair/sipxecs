How to build the Add in for outlook

Prerequisite
The “add in” is written in C# under visual studio 2005. The following references are required to build
	Microsoft .Net 2.0
	Office Object Library 12.0 -  Office.dll (comes with outlook 2007 )
	Outlook object library 12.0 – Microsoft.Office.Interop.outlook.dll (part of outlook 2007 PIA – Primary Interoperate Assembly, could be downloaded from microsoft or included in the office 2007 installation CD)
	Visual studio 2005 for C#.

To Build
1) (If you already have unzipped code base, skip this step) unzip the source code *.zip  to a directory. 
2) Open the solution file:AddinForOutlook.sln under the top directory from visual studio 2005
3) Three projects are included in the solution, 
	AddinForOutlook          –      the main project which generates the AddinForOutlook.Dll
	AddinForOutlookSetup  -     to build the Microsoft Installer file (.MSI file ) and its setup.exe file.
	AddinForOutlookSetupExt  - the extension to the installer.

4)  Select “build solution” from “build” menu item in the studio  which will cause both .dll and the .msi (and its setup.exe) to be built under the subdirectory “release” of AddinForOutlookSetup.

To Install
Copy setup.exe and the AddinForOutlook.msi to target machine, and click “setup.exe” and then follow the instruction to install.
