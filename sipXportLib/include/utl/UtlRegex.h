/**
 * RegEx impelments Perl-compatible regular expressions
 *
 * A simple and small C++ wrapper for PCRE.
 * PCRE (or libprce) is the Perl Compatible Regular Expression library.
 * http://www.pcre.org/
 *
 * Adapted for the sipXportLib from the regex.hpp wrapper:
 *
 * regex.hpp 1.0 Copyright (c) 2003 Peter Petersen (pp@on-time.de)
 * Simple C++ wrapper for PCRE
 *
 *   This source file is freeware. You may use it for any purpose without
 *   restriction except that the copyright notice as the top of this file as
 *   well as this paragraph may not be removed or altered.
 *
 * Original wrapper by Peter Petersen, adapted to sipX by Scott Lawrence
 *
 * The regular expression is compiled in the constructor, and then may be applied
 * to target strings using one of the Search interfaces.  The results are obtained
 * using the Results interfaces.
 *
 * This class is a wrapper around the PCRE package (see the project INSTALL for a
 * pointer to where PCRE can be found).  All the Options variables are identical
 * to those in pcre.h
 *
 * @note
 * Compiling the regular expressions is usually expensive compared to executing
 * the actual search, so if an expression is frequently reused, it is best to
 * compile it only once and then construct the expression to use in the search
 * using the copy constructor.
