Goal: To measure the media thruput performance of the symmitron.


Description

Experiments were performed with 100 bidrectional streams pushing data through 
the symmitron.  I allocated 50 bridges in the symmitron.  This would 
correspond to 50 concurrent phone calls.
Each bridge had a pair of Syms Each sym received data from a sender 
and forwarded it to the other side.
Measurements were made over 1000 packets. I performed the experiments
on my laptop ( dual core 2 ghz intel processor ) using localhost.
The symmitron ran in the same process as the sender and receiver. 


sender	---->| 		|---> receiver
	     |   bridge |
receiver<----|	        |<--- sender


Measurements
------------
Time between packets    Root Mean Square Jitter value (measured at receiver)

10 ms.                  PACKET LOSS occured.

20 ms.			6.17 ms. ( 0 packet loss ) 

40 ms.                  1.9 ms.  ( 0 packet loss )

80 ms.			1.15 ms. ( 0 packet loss ) 

160 ms.                 1.10 ms.  ( 0 packet loss )


Conclusion
---------

The bridge can easily perform at the desired design point of 50 concurrent 
calls.
