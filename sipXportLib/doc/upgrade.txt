General upgrade procedure

If you have configuration files that need to be upgraded or modified
in any way to move gracefully from 2.6 to 2.8 there is a general
mechanism in place now that you can use.

sipx-upgrade is an upgrade script that gets installed during the
commserver installation and is available in all other following
installs. I'm just going to go over the process for RPMs, install
from source will follow later.

For upgrades during the RPM install you have to modify the spec
files in the following way - add the lines

%pre
sipx-upgrade -p projectname -c

%post
sipx-upgrade -p projectname -u --ldir %{_localstatedir} \
                               --cdir %{_sysconfdir}

'projectname' is the name of the sipx package in lowercase letters
(sipxpublisher, sipxregistry etc.).

The first step runs sipx-upgrade during the pre-installation process
where it determines the upgrade path if any (was another package
already installed). It records the version number for the second
step.

The second step runs sipx-upgrade during post-installation and
passes in the _localstatedir (/var for RPMs) and _sysconfdir (/etc
for RPMs) which can be used to locate configuration files.

Now you have to add your upgrade operations to sipx-upgrade itself
(located in sipXcommserverLib/bin). A working example is already
included, I've moved Scott's upgrade function for sipXregistry and
sipXproxy into sipx-upgrade already so you can follow that model.

The first part of the script is the section that must be modified,
the later part contains support functions that should not be used
or called directly.

Example: To add an upgrade function for sipXvxml edit the script.
You will see something like this:

SipxUpgrade() {
    case $Project in

        ## Upgrade section of sipXpublisher - add upgrade call here
        ###########################################################
        sipxpublisher)
            ;;

        ## Upgrade section of sipXregistry - add upgrade call here
        ###########################################################
        sipxregistry)
            UpgradeRegistry
            ;;

        ## Upgrade section of sipXproxy - add upgrade call here
        ###########################################################
        sipxproxy)
            UpgradeProxy
            ;;

        ## Upgrade section of sipXconfig - add upgrade call here
        ###########################################################
        sipxconfig)
            ;;

        ## Upgrade section of sipXvxml - add upgrade call here
        ###########################################################
        sipxvxml)
            ;;

        ## Upgrade section of sipXpbx - add upgrade call here
        ###########################################################
        sipxpbx)
            ;;

        ## We shouldn't be here
        *)
            ;;
    esac
}

Add a function call 'UpgradeVxml' in the appropriate place:

        ## Upgrade section of sipXvxml - add upgrade call here
        ###########################################################
        sipxvxml)
            UpgradeVxml
            ;;

Now add that function in the section that begins with

## Add your upgrade functions in here
##
##    The following variables are available:
##
##          $Version   a version string of a previously installed project
##                     RPM in the format x.y.z
##          $Major     Major version number x of installed RPM
##          $Minor     Minor version number y of installed RPM
##          $Sub       Version number z of installed RPM
##          $Rel       Release number of installed RPM
##
##          $LocalStateDir   %{_localstatedir} if passed in with --sdir
##          $SysConfDir      %{_sysconfdir} if passed in with --cdir
###########################################################################

Add

UpgradeVxml() {
   ## If we found an already installed 2.6 package we must upgrade
   case $Version in
       2.6.2 | 2.6.1)
           ## Do some 2.6-to-2.8 stuff
           if [ "$Rel" = "2" ]; then
               ## Do some special stuff for release 2
           fi
           ;;

       2.8.0)
           ## Maybe we are at 2.8.1 and need to do something for 2.8.0
           ;;
}

and that's how you would add upgrade operations that will be performed
during the sipXvxml RPM install.
