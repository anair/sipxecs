<!-- INSTRUCTIONS FOR DESIGNERS WISHING TO ADD AN ALARM
  Each alarm is defined in the etc/sipXalarms-config.xml file, and identified by its
  unique id, which is an internal (not customer-visible) string.
  Strings containing the alarm description, a short title for the alarm,
  and suggested actions to resolve it, must be added in this file.  
  These strings can be localized for different languages (into sipXalarms-strings_xx.xml).

  Parameters provided at runtime can be inserted into the description string using placeholders
  of the form {n}.
