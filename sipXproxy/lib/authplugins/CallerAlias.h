/// Modify the From header of a request based on lookup in the caller-alias database.
/**
 * This AuthPlugin provides a caller aliasing feature by modifying the From header
 * in an initial request and maintaining the translation throughout the dialog.
 * It is intended to provide a way to modify the caller-id presented in a PSTN call.
 *
 * The translation is controlled by entries in the caller-alias sipdb, which has two key
 * columns: the caller identity and the target domain; and one output column: the From header
 * field value.
 *
 * On an initial request, the first test is for an exact match of the identity (user@domain,
 * with no parameters) in the From header of the request and the target domain (from the
 * request URI).  Note that the target domain for a PSTN call is the domain of some gateway,
 * which could be a local device or a remote SIP Trunk service.  The lookup is _not_
 * affected by any Route on the request, so a request to an ITSP that is Routed through
 * a local SBC matches on the ITSP domain, not that of the SBC.
 *
 * If an exact match is found, then the resulting From header from the output column
 * is substituted.  This is used to replace the identity of a specific user when calling
 * a specific domain.
 *
 * If no exact match is found, and if the existing From header identity is a user in the
 * domain of this proxy, then a second check is made in the caller-alias database for a
 * "wildcard" match: the caller identity used for this lookup is "*", and the target domain
 * from the request URI (as in the exact match test).  If this matches a row in the caller-alias
 * database, the From value from that row is substituted.  Note the exclusion: this wildcard
 * match is not attempted if the caller is not within the domain, so a call coming from outside
 * the domain that is forwarded by a local user is not aliased (the original outside
 * caller-id is maintained).
 *
 * If neither match finds a row in the caller-alias database, the From header is left unchanged.
 *
 * When a From header value is substituted, the entire value from the table is used, and the only
 * part of the original From header value that is preserved is the 'tag' field parameter.
 * Both the full original From header value and the aliased From header value are added to the
 * RouteState for the request.  This causes these values to be preserved in the route set.  As
 * subsequent requests and responses follow the route set through this proxy, this plugin
 * modifies the From header using these saved values so that each participant in the dialog
 * sees only the From header value they expect to see (the caller sees only the original value,
 * and the called party sees only the aliased value).
