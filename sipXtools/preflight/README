INTRODUCTION
============
Preflight is a network test utility used to verify the functionality of various
network services which are required for proper operation of the sipXecs system.
It is capable of testing proper operation of the following network services:
  DHCP
  DNS
  NTP
  TFTP
  FTP
  HTTP

It can also perform basic testing of the sipXecs proxy, registrar and publisher.

In addition, it also has a device discovery feature which allows it to locate
and identify SIP compliant telephones attached to the same network for which
the host running preflight is.

For details on the operation of the command line version of preflight, invoke
with the "--help" switch.


BUILDING PREREQUISITES
======================
There are two different versions of preflight, a command line version which
can be invoked on the sipXecs server either from a command shell or from the
diagnostics screen of the Config Server, and an optional graphical version
which can be installed on either Windows XP or Vista.  The graphical version,
although targeted for a Windows system, is built as part of a normal Linux
build.  Before this can be accomplished, the NSIS prerequisit package must be
installed:
