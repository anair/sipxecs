Functional Description
----------------------

SipxBridge is a integrated ITSP bridging solution ( SBC ) for sipx. It is
fully integrated with sipxconfig. It supports the following functions :

The sipXecs SIP trunking GW (SipxBridge) anchors media and provides rewriting of the SIP
headers so that packets can pass the firewall / NAT. It functions as a B2BUA,
thus reducing the size of outbound packets and shielding the ITSP from the
internal state that is carried in the sipx SIP messages. 

SipXbridge provides:

- SIP registration with a SIP trunking provider
- Fully integrated and configurable with sipxconfig.
- Support one or two Ethernet interfaces.
- Media anchoring and processing
- SIP signaling rewrite for NAT traversal
- NAT keepalive signaling.
- Full call transfer support ( attended and blind ) as well as hairpinned
  calls to the ITSP.
- Performance: Support for at least 2 x T1 channels
- SipxBridge does not provide failover support. 


A unit test plan for sipxbridge
------------------------------


1. ITSP Registration and configuration tests

This tests that SIPXBridge can Register ITSPs with and keeping Registrations fresh.

Registrations are of two types:

Those that use global addresses in outbound signaling if the ITSP
and those that use local ( private address ). In the latter case, the
ITSP will look at the IP address and port of the registering party and
determine where the registration is coming from. The third flavor is
ITSPs that do not require registrations but require that you provide an
IP address. It should be possible to configure sipxbridge to inter-operate
with all three different types of ITSP configurations.


To test for this, get accounts with ITSPs that require these different
type of configurations make sure that you can register and test with
each of these different configurations.

The following ITSPs have been tested against:

- eutelia.net ( requires STUN-determined global addresses for SIP/SDP  ).
- les.net ( requires private address for SIP/SDP ).
- callwithus.com ( requires STUN-determined global address for SIP/SDP ).

Tests are planned for :

- bandwidth.com (does not need registration).
- cbeyond.com ( sipconnect compliant ).



2.Deal with near end NAT traversal requirements. It should be possible to
place the bridge behind a NAT and bridge with the ITSP.  

The following tests need to be performed:

 - Ensure that calls can be set up through a symmetric NAT.

 - Keep NAT bindings alive using periodic outbound SIP Keep alive. Keep the
   system running but not making any calls for a period of time ( say 30 min)
   and test that you can still do inbound and outboudn calling.


3.Configurable with SipXconfig : 

 - Test that the system can be completely configured with SipXconfig
  
 - Test that the system is resillient when incorrect account information is
   entered ( no crashes or unbounded memory growth).


4.Acceptable media performance : 

 - Generate a background load of 50 media streams using the provided
   test program ( run the target "symclient" from a machine on the network 
   that is not the same machine as where sipxbridge is running ).

 - Make a phone call to the ITSP with this background load and make sure that
   the call set up time and voice quality are good.
  

5.Concurrency : A single bridge should be able to support multiple accounts
and concurrently process the call setup signaling and media needed by these
accounts. 

  - Configure the bridge with multiple ITSP accounts. 

  - Make concurrent inbound calls via the ITSP accounts.

  - Make sure calls can be concurrently placed.

6.NAT / SIPXBridge Reboots:  

  - Reboot the NAT and make sure that Sipxbridge continues to function after
    NAT reboot by placing inbound and outbound calls.

7.Interoperability : SIPXBridge should work with commonly used
phones and NATs. 
	
  - Test that SipXbridge can work from behind a few popular "Routers" 
    (Linksys, Motorola).

  - Use the supported phones to make the call transfers outlined in the Call
    Transfer Manual Test cases section below for each of these Routers.


8. Support one and two armed operation: It may be needed to place the ITSP
facing side of the B2BUA on a publicly rout-able address (especially for Phase
2). For this mode of operation, it should be possible to put one side of the
SIPXBridge on the public network (in the DMZ). 

 - Ensure that SIPXBridge can be configured and made to work on a machine with
   two network interfaces. The private and public address will run on
   different Network Interfaces in this case.



9. Interoperability with existing SipX services that transfer or park calls.
 
 - Test that sipxbridge can send inbound calls to the SIPX Auto Attendant and
   transfer calls from there.
 - Test that inbound calls can be parked and retrieved.
 - Test that inbound calls can be transferred to the conferencing bridge via
   the auto attendant.



10.Logging support: Support logging of messages and signaling in the syslog
format expected by the SIPX trace viewing (sipXviewer) tool.

 - Test that sipxbridge generates log records in a fashion that can be merged
   and viewed by the sipviewer tool.



11. Must support attended and blind transfers for supported phones. 

This will require several different makes of supported phones. The transfers
outlined below must work pairwise between the supported phones for this test.

You need a valid ITSP account configured to perform these tests.
"PSTN phone" is synonymous with your cell phone. Please use a second
cell number for hair-pinned scenarios.

Scenario : Simple Inbound and Outbound calling with different models of
phones.  

Objective: To test interoperability for simple in and outbound calls
for different models of phones.

Procedure: Register phones with SipX and call inbound and
outbound. Inbound calls should be routed through auto attendant.


Scenario: Blind call transfer between sip phones. Inbound calling.

Objective: Test if blind transfer between different models of phones
works when phone calls are received from ITSP.  

Procedure: Connect two SIP phones to SipX.  Make an inbound call to SipX
using a PSTN phone to call in via the ITSP.  Transfer blind between  the
two SIP phones for the inbound call from ITSP.


Scenario: Blind call transfer between sip phones. Outbound calling.

Objective: Test if blind transfer between different models of phones
works when phone calls are placed to ITSP.  

Procedure: Connect two SIP phones to SipX.  Make an outbound call to
a PSTN phone number via the ITSP using a SIP phone.  Transfer blind to
the second phone for the outbound call via ITSP.


Scenario: Hair-pinned Blind call transfer between PSTN phones. Inbound
calling.  

Objective: Test if blind transfer between ITSP works when phone calls
are received from a PSTN number via ITSP.

Procedure: Connect a SIP phone to SipX. Make an inbound call via the
ITSP. Transfer blind between phone and second PSTN number via the ITSP.


Scenario: Hair-pinned Blind call transfer between PSTN phones. Outbound
calling.  

Objective: Test if blind transfer between PSTN works when phone calls
are initiated from SIP phone via ITSP.

Procedure: Connect a SIP phone to SipX. Make an outbound call. Transfer
blind between phone and second PSTN number via the ITSP.


Scenario: Attended transfer between SIP phones. Inbound calling.

Objective: Test if attended transfer between phones works when phone
calls are received from ITSP.  

Procedure: Connect two SIP phones to SipX. Transfer attended between the
two phones for inbound calls from ITSP.  Make sure the MOH is disabled
for the phone but enabled in sipxbridge. You should hear MOH during
the transfer.

Scenario: Attended transfer between SIP phones. Outbound calling.

Objective: Test if attended transfer between phones works when phone
calls are initiated from SIPX via ITSP.  

Procedure: Connect two SIP phones to SipX. Initiate an outbound call
to the PSTN via the ITSP from one of the phones.  Transfer attended
between the two phones for outbound calls to ITSP.  Make sure the MOH
is disabled for the phone but enabled in sipxbridge. You should hear
MOH on the phone that is on hold during the transfer.

Scenario: Attended hair-pinned transfer between PSTN phones. Inbound
calling.  

Objective: Test if attended transfer between PSTN phones works
when phone calls are outbound from SIPX via ITSP.  

Procedure: Connect one SIP phone to SipX. Make an inbound call from a
PSTN number via the ITSP.  Transfer attended between phone and a second
PSTN number via the ITSP.  You should hear MOH during the transfer on
the first PSTN phone during the transfer.

Scenario: Attended hair-pinned transfer between PSTN phones. Outbound calling.

Objective: Test if attended transfer between PSTN works when phone calls
are outbound from SIPX via ITSP.

Procedure: Connect one SIP phone to SipX. Make an outbound call to a
PSTN number via the ITSP.  Transfer attended between phone and a second
PSTN number via the ITSP.  Make sure the MOH is disabled for the phone
but enabled in sipxbridge. You should hear MOH during the transfer on
the first PSTN phone.


12. Stability under error conditions:

  For each of the scenrios above

 - Test for robustness by transfering calls to non-existant phones and ITSP
   numbers.
 
 - Test that sipxbridge is resilient to phone disconnections without explicit 
   phone hangup (for example disconnect the ethernet cable on the LAN side and
   test that sipxbridge will hang up the ongoing call).
