Welcome to sipxbridge -- the little bridge that could.

THIS IS AN EARLY (BETA) RELEASE. 

SipXbridge is ITSP bridge geared towards the needs of the SIPX PBX system.
It aims to provide media and signaling gatewaying functionality  between
SIP endpoints inside a firewall /NAT and an external ITSP gateway.


Start sipx and configure sipx to use sipxbridge
----------------------------------------------

- sipxbridge will start as a service when you start sipx.

- configure sipxbridge using sipxconfig. Sipxbridge is configured as an SBC. 
The settings will vary according to your ITSP.

- Set up a dial plan to use sipxbridge as your sbc. You can set up 
a prefix ( say 91 + number ) to direct your calls to sipxbridge.

- On your pstn phone, dial your ITSP provided  number for inbound (to sipx) 
calls. Dial 91your-phone-number for outbound calls.

- Try a few call transfers etc.

Firewall/NAT considerations
---------------------------

Some ITSPs work without any NAT configuration needed. They work by
ignoring the SIP/SDP port information -- relying instead on the remote
address of the incoming datagram packet. Such ITSPs require no NAT
configuration. Other ITSPs will send packets to the specified ports if
you use global addresses and will look at the inbound UDP to determine
ports if you use local addresses in your signaling.  Yet other ITSPs
are more particular. They will expect you to provide a valid port in
your singaling and only send packets to the specified port. To cover
all cases, you need to

1. Configure sipxbridge to use the mechanism that your ITSP expects to see.
2. Possibly configure your NAT/Firewall to forward inbound packets from your ITSP.

To configure your NAT/Firewall, you need to set up port forwarding in
the port range that sipxbridge uses.

Here are my linux firewall rules:

iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p udp --dport 15000:15500 -j DNAT --to-destination 192.168.5.240
iptables -A FORWARD -i $EXTIF -o $INTIF0 -d 192.168.5.240 -p udp --dport 15000:15500 -j ACCEPT

Here, my sipxbridge runs in the port range 15000 to 15600 
EXTIF is my WAN-facing interface ( eth3 ).
INTIF is my WAN-facing interface ( eth0 ).

Warnings and disclaimers
------------------------

THIS IS  NOT YET PRODUCTION READY.

It has only been minimally tested.
