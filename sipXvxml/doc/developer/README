This is a short description of the files in this directory.  Beware
that this directory is not maintained documentation; these files may
be out of date.

HIPO

	Start on a "Hierarchy, Input, Processing, Output" description
	of the media server.

	Lists files mentioning SpeechWorks.  These files must be
	derived from the VXI distribution.  But some are clearly not
	drop-in SpeechWorks files, for example, clientMain.cpp.  The
	SpeechWorks VXI should probably be cleanly separated.

	Detailed notes on building sipXvxml.

build-script.sh

	A script to build sipXvxml, based on the instructions in build-notes.

call-setup

	Incoming call processing sequence for a call that goes to
	voicemail.

	The hierarchy of classes in the media server.

	How the Voice XML "prompt" element is processed by the media
	server.
