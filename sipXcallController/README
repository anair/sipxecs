Third party call controller
===========================

This is the RESTLET based third party call controller.

Currently we only support REFER based third party call control. 

This service runs as a plugin in the SipXrest container.


There are three parties involved :

The agent that initiates the call. This is the last part of the URL. The callController masquerades as the agent.
The calling party to which the call is initially placed. This is the callingParty parameter
The called party to which the call is REFERRed. This is the calledParty parameter.

An alias may be used anywhere a SIP user name is used.

The call controller consults etc/sipxpbx/validusers.xml to authenticate users and map user aliases to user names.

The general form of the URL is

https://host:6666/rest/callcontroller/callingParty/calledParty?agent=agentName&calledParty=calledPartyName&pin=pin

You dont need a pin to invoke it from within the sipx domain. You can specify user name or user alias for agentName, 
callingParty or calledParty.

You dont need to specify the pin when calling this service from within the sipx domain. When the callingParty is 
not specified, it is assumed to be the same as the agent. The calledParty parameter is mandatory.

callingParty and calledParty can be a foreign domain ( for example you would want to do that for calls directed to an ITSP ).
If you do not specify a full address (i.e. name@domain), the domain is assumed to be the sipx domain.
agentName must have a PBX account (for authentication purposes ). 
If you do not specify a callingParty this is assumed to be the same as the agent.

For example within the sipx domain, the URL can look like this:
https://sipxpbx.sipxtest.net:6666/rest/callcontroller/201/202

Here 201 can be either the user name or the alias of a user.
It is is both the agent placing the call as well as the calling party.

To invoke this from outside the sipx domain :
http://sipxpbx.sipxtest.net:6666/rest/callcontroller/201/202

It will use HTTP digest authentication for call setup.

Optional URL parameters:
=======================

agent - the name of the agent that is placing the third party call.
subject  - this URL parameter determines what goes into the SIP subject header of the initial call setup INVITE.
method - defaults to REFER
   REFER based third party call control is "Fire and Forget"
   The call is placed and subsequently, the third party call controller is not in the call path.
   INVITE based TPCC keeps the controller in the call path ( not yet implemented ).
isForwardingAllowed - whether or not forwarding is allowed for the initial invite
pin - authentication pin.
