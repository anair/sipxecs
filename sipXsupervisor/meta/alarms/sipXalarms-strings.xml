<!-- INSTRUCTIONS FOR DESIGNERS WISHING TO ADD AN ALARM
  Each alarm is defined in the AlarmDefinitions.xml file, and identified by its
  unique id, which is an internal (not customer-visible) string.
  Strings containing the alarm description, and suggested actions to resolve it, must
  be added in this file.  These strings can be localized for different languages.
  Parameters provided at runtime can be inserted into the strings using placeholders
  of the form {n}.
