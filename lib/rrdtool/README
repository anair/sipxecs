Description:
RRD is the Acronym for Round Robin Database. RRD is a system to store and
display time-series data (i.e. network bandwidth, machine-room temperature,
server load average). It stores the data in a very compact way that will not
expand over time, and it presents useful graphs by processing the data to
enforce a certain data density. It can be used either via simple wrapper
scripts (from shell or Perl) or via frontends that poll network devices and
put a friendly user interface on it.

Local copy of rrdtool.spec modified from original source to produce only
rrdtool package and rrdtool-perl Perl bindings package.
