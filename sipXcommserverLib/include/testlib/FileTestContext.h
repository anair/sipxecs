/**
 * This class and its subclasses abstract the locations of files that would normally
 * be hardcoded so that tests can use locations in the build tree and provide different
 * input sets for each test.
 *
 * A typical test that reads and writes files can declare a FileTestContext so that the input
 * files are copied from the source tree to the build tree, possibly modified along the way
 * by a TemplateConverter supplied by the test or some subclass of FileTestContext.  Typically
 * the paths to the source and build tree will be provided from the build environment.
 *
 * @note
 * <strong>The working directory will be deleted and recreated</strong>, so it must not
 * be in the source tree.
