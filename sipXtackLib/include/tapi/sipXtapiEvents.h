 * sipXtapi event declarations
 *
 * The sipXtapiEvents.h header file defines all of the events fired as part of
 * receiving inbound calls and placing outbound calls.  Each event notification
 * is comprised of a major event and a minor event.  The major event identifies
 * a significant state transition (e.g. from connected to disconnected.  The minor
 * event identifies the reason for the change (cause code).
 *
 * Below you will find state diagrams that show the typical event transitions
 * for both outbound and inbound calls.
