# This script is only meant to be called by the MRTG framework when thresholds are exceeded.
# Because the MRTG is very limited in how it can invoke scripts, we must map here.
# When a threshold is EXCEEDED, mrtg will invoke sipx-mrtg-threshexceeded (this is configured
# in mrtg/mrtg.cfg during sipx installation).
# In this case there are four parameters: target, threshold, current value, and a description.
# When a threshold recovers, mrtg will invoke sipx-mrtg-threshok.
# In this case there are three parameters: target, threshold, current value, and no description (go figure!).
# In both cases the THRESH_DESC environment variable will have been set.  This has been configured
# in mrtg/mrtg.cfg to be the beginning part of the alarm id.
# The sipx-mrtg-thresholdexceeded and sipx-mrtg-threshok scripts both append the value
# EXCEEDED or OK as appropriate to the THRESH_DESC and use the
# resulting string as the id of the alarm to generate.  The target, current value and threshold will
# be passed to the alarm as parameters.
