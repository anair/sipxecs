/**
 * XmlContent provides conversion functions for escaping and unescaping UtlStrings
 * as appropriate for use in XML attribute and element content.
 *
 * At present, this makes no accomodation for character set differences; input is assumed
 * to be 8 bits.  The following characters are encoded using the mandatory character
 * entities:
 *   - < => &lt;
 *   - & => &amp;
 *   - > => &gt;
 *   - ' => &apos;
 *   - " => &quot;
 *
 * Other character values outside the range of valid 8-bit characters in XML:
 * - [pound]x09 | [pound]x0A | [pound]x0D | [[pound]x20-[pound]FF]
 * are encoded using the numeric entity encoding (&[pound]x??;).
 *
 * While this is not strictly XML conformant (in that it does not explicitly deal with
 * larger-size character encodings), it is symmetric (escaping and unescaping any string
 * with these routines will always produce the original string), and will interoperate
 * correctly for any 8 bit encoding.
