/** Class for managing body content to be accepted via PUBLISH or provided in NOTIFY requests
 *
 *  This class is a database that is used to store and retrieve
 *  content (i.e. SIP Event state bodies).  This class does not
 *  actually touch or process SIP messages.  It is used by other
 *  classes and applications to store and retrieve content related to
 *  SIP SUBSCRIBE, NOTIFY and PUBLISH requests.  The usual usage is to
 *  have one instance that maintains state for an unlimited number of
 *  resources and event types.
 *
 *  The resourceId and eventTypeKey have no semantics.  Syntactically,
 *  they are restricted only by:  (1) resourceId may not be the null
 *  string, and (2) eventTypeKey may not contain a byte with the value
 *  1 (control-A), so that the concatenation of resourceId and
 *  eventTypeKey can be split unambiguously.
 *
 *  Conventionally, resourceId is usually a SIP URI without parameters
 *  ("sip:user@hostport"), which will be the request-URI of the
 *  SUBSCRIBE or PUBLISH for the information, and that is how the
 *  Subscribe Server and Publish Server implementations use them.
 *
 *  It is up to the application or event package to decide what the
 *  resourceId and eventTypeKey look like.  In addition, there is an
 *  eventType that may provide a coarser classification than
 *  eventTypeKey.  Callback functions are registered for eventTypes
 *  rather than eventTypeKeys, so the set of eventTypeKeys is not
 *  limited at compile time.
 *  
 *  A suggested convention for the resourceId
 *  is to use:  <userId>@<hostname>[:port] as provided in the
 *  SUBSCRIBE or PUBLISH request URI.  It is suggested that host be
 *  the domainname not the specific IP address.
 *
 *  It is also suggested the SIP event type token be used (without any
 *  event header parameters) as the eventTypeKey.  Only in special
 *  cases where the content varies based upon an event parameter,
 *  should the parameter(s) be include included in the eventTypeKey.
 *  Usually, eventType is the same as eventTypeKey, or is the
 *  SIP event type alone, if eventTypeKey contains parameters.
 *
 * \par Put Event State In
 *  Applications put Event state information for a specific resourceId
 *  and eventTypeKey into the SipPublishContentMgr via the publish method.
 *
 * \par Retrieve Event State
 *  Applications retrieve published content type via the getContent
 *  method.
 *
 * \par Remove Event State
 * All event state information for a resource Id and event type key can
 * can be removed via the unpublish method.  The content associated
 * with the keys is passed back so the application can destroy the
 * content.
 *
 * \par Default Event State
 * It is possible to define a default event state for an event type key.
 * This default content is provided in the getContent method if no
 * content was provided for the specific resource Id.  Default content
 * is set via the publishDefault method.
