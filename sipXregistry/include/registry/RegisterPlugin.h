/**
 * SIP Registrar Plugin Hook Action.
 *
 * A RegisterPlugin is an action invoked by the SipRegistrarServer whenever a
 *   successful REGISTER request has been processed (that is, after it has
 *   effected its change on the registry database).  The plugin may then take
 *   any action based on the fact that the registration has occured.
 *
 * This class is the abstract base from which all RegisterPlugins must inherit.
 *
 * To configure a RegisterPlugin into the SipRegistrarServer, the registrar-config
 * file should have a directive configuring the plugin library:
 * @code
 * SIP_REGISTRAR_HOOK_LIBRARY.[instance] : [path to libexampleregplugin.so]
 * @endcode
 * Where [instance] is replaced by a unique plugin name, and the value
 * points to the libary that provides the plugin code.
 *
 * In addition to the class derived from this base, a RegisterPlugin library must
 * provide a factory routine named getRegisterPlugin with extern "C" linkage so
 * that the OsSharedLib mechanism can look it up in the dynamically loaded library
 * (looking up C++ symbols is problematic because of name mangling).
 * The factory routine looks like:
 * @code
 * class ExampleRegisterPlugin : public RegisterPlugin
 * {
 *    virtual void takeAction( const SipMessage&   registerMessage ///< the successful registration
 *                            ,const unsigned int  registrationDuration ///< the actual allowed
 *                                                                      /// registration time (note
 *                                                                      /// that this may be < the
 *                                                                      /// requested time).
 *                            ,SipUserAgent*       sipUserAgent     ///< to be used if the plugin
 *                                                                  /// wants to send any SIP msg
 *                            );
 *
 *    friend RegisterPlugin* getRegisterPlugin(const UtlString& name);
 * }
 *
 * extern "C" RegisterPlugin* getRegisterPlugin(const UtlString& instance)
 * {
 *   return new ExampleRegisterPlugin(instance);
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * @see Plugin
