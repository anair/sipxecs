SIPX Openfire integration plugin.

1. Install openfire and build it. 

Initialize it following the instructions on the openfire web site.
You will need to initialize the database schema etc.
URL : http://www.igniterealtime.org/builds/openfire/docs/latest/documentation/database.html#postgres

2. OPENFIRE_HOME is the directory of openfire under which you have lib, bin, logs etc.

To configure for build, from the BUILD directory issue something like this:

../configure --cache-file=`pwd`/ac-cache-file SIPXPBXUSER=`whoami` OPENFIRE_HOME=/opt/openfire/

cd sipXopenfire

make all install 

Will build the plugin and install it in the right place under openfire's
directory structure.

4. Edit and install the sipxopenfire.xml.example file here copy it to
etc/sipxpbx/sipxopenfire.xml

5. Note: You will need to run the openfire web server at another
address. The default addresses 9090 and 9091 cause conflicts.  Run the web
server at some other address ( see modified openfire.xml.example here ).

If you have installed and configured correctly, your openfire.xml file
will look like the example one in this directory. The http server is used
for administration of openfire as well as for xml RPC. This will probably
change in future.

Make sure the xml rpc ports in sipxopenfire matches the web server port
in openfire.xml. You will find openfire.xml in OPENFIRE_HOME/config after
you install openfire and configure it. Make sure you are using postgres
as your database for openfire.

You should be able to start/stop the openfire service from sipx.
