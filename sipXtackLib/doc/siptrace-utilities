* syslog2siptrace

syslog2siptrace is a binary that uses the sipX libraries.  It is built
in sipXtackLib/syslog2siptrace, and installed in
.../bin/syslog2siptrace.

It reads a sipX .log file and produces an XML summary of the incoming
and outgoing SIP messages in the log, which is called a "siptrace"
file.

Typical usage:  syslog2siptrace <file.log >file.xml

* siptrace-merge

siptrace-merge is a Perl script in
sipXtackLib/syslog2siptrace/siptrace-merge.  It combines one or more
siptrace files to produce a summary siptrace file.  It also takes a
number of arguments to select subsets of the SIP messages to include
in the output file.  See the top of the file for a list of options.

Typical usage:  siptrace-merge [selection-options] file.xml ... >merged.xml

* sipviewer

sipviewer is a standalone Java program.  The source is in
sipXtackLib/sipviewer, and is installed in .../bin/sipviewer and
.../lib/sipviewer.  It displays the SIP messages in a siptrace file in
a nice graphical format.

Typical usage:  sipviewer file.xml

* merge-logs

merge-logs is a Bash script in
sipXtackLib/syslog2siptrace/merge-logs.  It is a wrapper around
syslog2siptrace and siptrace-merge to make them more convenient.  It
converts the specified log files (or *.log) into siptrace files, then
merged them (using any specified arguments) into one siptrace file,
merged.xml.

Typical usage:  cd .../var/log/sipxpbx
                merge-logs --exclude-method=REGISTER
                sipviewer merged.xml
