CDR Log Restlet plugin
===========================

This is a RESTLET plugin which provides a resource whereby one can obtain the
Call Logs for a particular user.  Records are sorted by start date in descending
order.


The CDR Log consults etc/sipxpbx/validusers.xml to authenticate users and map user aliases to user names.

The general form of the URL is

https://host:6666/cdr/user?fromdate=yyyymmdd&limit=<max # of records to return>

Optional URL parameters:
=======================

fromdate - start date from which call records will be retrieved.
limit    - maximum number of call log records to return.
