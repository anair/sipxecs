/**
 * This class encapsulates SipXauthIdentity and P-Asserted-Identity information. SipXauthIdentity 
 * is used by upstream proxies to instruct sipXauthproxy that a request needs to be routed based 
 * on the permisssions of an by upstream proxies to instruct sipXauthproxy that a request needs to
 * be routed based on the permisssions of an identity different from that of the request originator.
 * P-Asserted-Identity is to communicate the identity of the subscribers as described in RFC3325.
 * Given the lack of TLS support for many SIP elements deployed today, to ensure the security and 
 * prevent from forgery, replay, and falsification, P-Asserted-Identity is also encapsulated in the 
 * same manner as SipXauthIdentity.
 * 
 * SipXauthIdentity can be used for a veriety of purposes, but at least initially it is used to 
 * allow privileged users to forward their calls to destinations that require permissions.
 *
 * SipXauthIdentity information is carried in X-Sipx-Authidentity header of the follwoing format:
 *
 *     X-Sipx-Authidentity: <identity;signature=<timestamp>:<signature-hash>>
 *
 * P-Asserted-Identity information is carried in P-Asserted-Identity header of the follwoing format:
 *
 *     P-Asserted-Identity: 'displayName' <identity;signature=<timestamp>:<signature-hash>>
 * where
 * - "displayName" is a displayName of the subscriber.
 * - "identity" is a user identity in addr-spec format as a SIP-URI.
 * - "timestamp" is epoch seconds as hex without "0x" prefix indicating the 
 *   time the signature was generated.
 * - "signature-hash" is MD5(<timestamp><secret><from-tag><call-id><identity>)
 * 
 * The value of X-Sipx-Authidentity and P-Asserted-Identity headers are signed using MD5. The 
 * signature is calculated over the content of the header value, signature timestamp, data from 
 * the SIP message and a unique secret, known only to sipXecs components in a given installation.
 * This should prevent (or minimize) the replay attacks on the system making it
 * relatively difficuilt to spoof the X-Sipx-Authidentity and P-Asserted-Identity headers.
 *
 * Signature includes a timestamp as epoch seconds indicating when the signature was calculated.
 * Signature validation fails if the signature is older then a configurable mout of time.
 * Timestamp validation can be disabled and it is disabled by default untill non-zero duration
 * interval is specified via a call to setSignatureValidityInterval.
 *
 * To access the sipXauthIdentity or P-Asserted-Identity information in a message, construct a 
 * SipXauthIdentity object passing the SipMessage and header type( sipXauthIdentity or 
 * P-Asserted-Identity to the SipXauthIdentity constructor, Use getIdentity/setIdentity method 
 * to get and set identity. Use getIdentity/setIdentity method to get and set identity.Use remove
 * and insert methods to remove and put the identity info from/into the message.
