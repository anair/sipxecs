/**
 * SipxResources are declared by an element belonging to the resource class in the
 * sipXecs-process schema (a sub-element of the 'resources' element in a 'process' document).
 * They control three aspects of sipXsupervisor functionality:
 *
 * - Only something that is declared to be a resource can be written using the configuration
 *   replication methods (@see FileRpcMethod and ImdbRpcMethod).
 *
 * - A Process definition can declare that a resource is 'required', which means that:
 *   - The Process can not start before that SipxResource is "ready"
 *     The definition of "ready" differs depending on the subclass of SipxResource.
 *   - The Process can not stop before that SipxResource is no longer "in use".
