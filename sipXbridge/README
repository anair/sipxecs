Welcome to sipxbridge -- the little bridge that could.

THIS IS AN EARLY (BETA) RELEASE. 

SipXbridge is ITSP bridge geared towards the needs of the SIPX PBX system.
It aims to provide media and signaling gatewaying functionality  between
SIP endpoints inside a firewall /NAT and an external ITSP gateway.


Start sipx and configure sipx to use sipxbridge
----------------------------------------------

- configure sipxbridge using sipxconfig. Sipxbridge is configured as an SBC. 
The settings will vary according to your ITSP.

a prefix ( say 91 + number ) to direct your calls to sipxbridge.

- On your pstn phone, dial your ITSP provided  number for inbound (to sipx) 
calls. Dial 91your-phone-number for outbound calls.
