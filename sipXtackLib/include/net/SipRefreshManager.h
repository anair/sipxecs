     *         The dialog state is indicted by the fact that expiration

     *  \param applicationData - pass back of application data provided upon
     *         adding SUBSCRIBE or REGISTER to be refreshed
     *  \param responseCode - SIP response code 200-299 Success, > 300 failure
     *         Has no meaning if subscribeResponse is NULL
     *         NOTE: a failure code does not mean that the subscription or

     *         may have succeeded and may not have expired yet.
     *  \param responseText - SIP response text. NULL if subscribeResponse is NULL
     *  \param expiration - epoch time in seconds when expiration of subscription
     *         or registration will occur.  A value of zero indicates that
     *         a unSUBSCRIBE or unREGISTER occurred and that it has expired
     *         and that no further attempts will be made to reSUBSCRIBE or
     *         reREGISTER.  Usual zero indicates that the application stopped
     *         the refresh.  A value of -1 indicates that no requests have 
     *         succeeded yet. A value greater than zero and less than the 
     *         current epoch time indicates the SUBSCRIBE or REGISTER has 
     *         expired most likely because of a request failure.
     *  \param subscribeResponse - SIP SUBSCRIBE or REGISTER response which
     *         stimulated the state change.  May be NULL.
