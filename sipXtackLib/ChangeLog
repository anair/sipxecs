Release Notes - sipXtackLib - Version 2.6.2

** Bug
    * [XSL-38] - SdpBody::setValue does not update existing values
    * [XSL-41] - SIP logs show an error message "unknown protocol using UDP"  in many places
    * [XSL-45] - Messages saying "Not all content data successfully read"
    * [XSL-46] - Many messages "matches via address: xxx port: xxx but is not trusted"
    * [XSL-47] - Many messages "ACK matches transaction with 2XX class response"
    * In SipMessage.cpp:
         Even with non-proxy based authentication, we should always
         validate the MD5 hash with the Auth header uri parameter.
         The code was using the request URI for registration requests
         incorrectly assuming the request URI and the Auth header
         uri parameter would always match (it should, but some UACs get
         this wrong).
