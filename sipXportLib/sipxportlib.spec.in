# sipXphone would require 0.9.7c to decrypt profiles to get access to
# certain new alg.  If this is still nec., this may need to be
# changed.  But in the meantime, Red Hat Enterprise 3.0 as of 08/16/04
# still uses 0.9.7a, so this is used. There's a HUGE implications of
# requiring RHEnterpise users to jeopardize their system by upgrading
# security package to a RH uncertified version.
Requires: openssl >= 0.9.7a
Requires: pcre >= 4.5

%description
This library provides a set of classes that provide an operating
system abstraction from a majority of OS provided functions. All of
the sipX projects use this library to ensure easy porting to any
operating system. The library currently provides classes that
encapsulate functions and operations for:

  * Threads
  * Locks and Mutexes
  * Semaphores
  * Messages and Queues
  * Timers
  * Time and Date
  * Sockets
  * File and Directory
  * Operating System Processes
  * Dynamic loading of shared libraries and symbols

# makeinstall RPM macro doesn't leverage DESTDIR but instead overrides
# libdir, bindir, etc just for make install. This not copesetic w/how
# our makefiles are built, they'd rather preserve libdir, and use
# DESTDIR when copying/moving/creating files.  The approach we're taking
# is quite standard, so it's surprising RPM's makeinstall macro is
# the way it is.

# Correct the group of any sipX file that has group 4294967295.
# (Actually, it will catch any file with a group number that is
# not in /etc/group.)
# This is done here in sipXportLib so it completes before the
# components that call pkg-upgrade are installed, to avoid the
# bug in pkg-upgrade triggered by such files.
# Suppress error output, as all good RPM scriptlets should produce no
# output at all.
