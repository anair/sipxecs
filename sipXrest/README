SipX REST Server
===========================

This is the RESTLET based server that implements a plugin mechanism whereby REST 
services can be added seperately.

The RESTLET based server application starts up a Jetty Server that will listen in
on a port designated for HTTP requests and another port for HTTPS requests.

Plugins are to be designed as RESTLET applications that implement a defined interface (IPlugin)
and are expected to setup their route and parameters appropriately.
