/// Manage a single sipXecs service process.
/**
 * A SipxProcess object represents the process that is providing some
 * sipXecs service.  It is instantiated by the SipxProcessManager by calling
 * the SipxProcess::createFromDefinition method, passing the path to an XML
 * process definition file.
 *
 * @image html uml.png "Overview of SipxProcesses and SipxResources"
 *
 * To locate a particular SipxProcess object, call SipxProcessManager::find.
 *
 * @par(SipxProcess and Resource creation)
 *
 * SipxProcess objects are created by the createFromDefinition, called from
 * SipxProcessManager::instantiateProcesses with each process definition document (see
 * sipXsupervisor/meta/sipXecs-process.xsd.in). 
 *
 * The parsing of the 'resources' element is delegated to SipxResource::parse,
 * which in turn delegates it to the appropriate resource subclass.  The connections
 * from a SipxProcess to the SipxResources it depends on are created by callbacks from
 * those resource parsing routines:
 
 * @msc
 *    SipxProcess, SipxResource, xxxResource;
 *
 *               ---    [label="Undefined State (parsing definition)"];
 *    SipxProcess        =>     SipxResource               [label="SipxResource::parse"];
 *    SipxProcess           <=  SipxResource               [label="requireResource"];
 *    SipxProcess -> SipxProcess                           [label="insert in mRequiredResources"];
 *    SipxProcess           >>  SipxResource               ;
 *                          SipxResource =>   xxxResource  [label="xxxResource::parse"];
 *                          SipxResource <=   xxxResource  [label="parseAttribute"];
 *    SipxProcess           <=  SipxResource               [label="resourceIsOptional"];
 *    SipxProcess -> SipxProcess                           [label="remove from mRequiredResources"];
 *    SipxProcess           >>  SipxResource               ;
 *                          SipxResource >>   xxxResource  ;
 *                          SipxResource <<   xxxResource  [label="(bool)"];
 *    SipxProcess        <<     SipxResource               [label="(bool)"];
 *
 * @endmsc
 *
 * @note If the SipxResource::parse returns 'false', the definition is considered invalid,
 *       and the SipxProcess object is discarded, so any dependencies that go with it are also
 *       eliminated.  This leaves the SipxProcessResource for this SipxProcess name, and possibly
 *       other SipxResource objects is created 'orphaned', but since they only retain the
 *       pointer to the SipxProcessResource (which continues to exist), this is ok.
 *
 * Each SipxProcess object has a paired SipxProcessResource object.
 *
 * @par(SipxProcess State Machine:)
 *
 * The following shows the states and transition events for a SipxProcess:
 *
 * @dot
 * digraph map {
 * rankdir=LR;
 * node [shape=ellipse];
 *
 * subgraph stable_states {
 * rank=same;
 * rankdir=LR;
 * node [shape=box];
 * Undefined     [label="Undefined"];
 * Disabled      [label="Disabled"];
 * Running [label="Running"];
