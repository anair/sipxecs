sipXtackLib itself is a library with end user application however the
following tools either use this library or are related to SIP stack
information processing.

SIP Related Utilities
================================

Each of the following tools can be executed from the
commandline. Listed here the commands to either display the
commandline usage or in the case of siptest, start program where help
can be displayed.

siplog2siptrace -h
 Convert SIP logs generated from sipXphone to an
XML format used for XML based tools, namely the sipviewer. Future
enhancements would be to support other import formats.

siptest
 Interactive terminal based application to send and recieve
SIP based messages to other servers.  After starting siptest
the "help" command will provide a list of commands which can be
run from the siptest shell.  "help" <command> will give help on
a specific command.  An example request that can be sent using
the "send" command from siptest is in siptest/src/siptest/invite.txt
The "rt" command sets a template which is used to generate
responses to incoming requests.  The format of the template
file is the same as a SIP response message file.
The ports that siptest listen on can be set my creating a file
called siptest-config in the directory from which siptest is 
started that contains the following parameters:
SIP_TEST_TCP_PORT : 3000
SIP_TEST_UDP_PORT : 3000

syslog2siptrace -h
 Convert SIP logs generated by many sipX servers to
an XML format used for XML based tools, namely the sipviewer. Future
enhancements would be to support other import formats

sipviewer -h
 Java based graphical viewer of siptrace xml files.
