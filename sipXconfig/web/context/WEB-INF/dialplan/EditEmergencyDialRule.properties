label.callerSensitive=Use caller sensitive forwarding
description.callerSensitive=Select this option if you need to route emergency calls differently depending on the location of the caller. \
	Use it only for phones that do not support configuring emergency gateways directly.
help.text=If this is the first, enabled emergency dialing rule configured to not use caller sensitive forwarding, \
   and has at least one gateway and that gateway \
   does not also have an additional route configured, then specific phones will default to \
   establish emergency calls directly to that gateway. These specific phones will be any phone of \
   the following models:{0}\
   You can change this behavior by changing the emergency configuration for those phones or phone groups explicitly.<br/>\
   Remember to send profiles to appropriate phones.<br/>\  
   For phones of models not shown in the above list, emergency calls will continue to be established by the proxy \
   and follow this dial plan much like any other call.
