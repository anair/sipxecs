    * The 'service' is the URI scheme, "sip" or "sips".
    *
    * The 'port' argument is the port number supplied in the URI, or a
    * negative number if none was supplied.
    * If none was supplied, SRV records are consulted.  If no SRV records
    * are found, port defaults to 5060 for "sip" service and 5061 for
    * "sips" service.
    *
    * The 'socketType' restricts the search to that sort of transport,
    * and may have the values (within IpProtocolSocketType):
    *    TCP
    *    UDP
    *    SSL_SOCKET
    *    UNKNOWN (all of the above are acceptable)
    * It is used if the URI or other context information specifies a transport.
    * If UNKNOWN is specified, servers() attempts to return addresses for
    * all transports that it knows about that are compatible with the service.
    * (If socketType is incompatible with service, no addresses will
    * be returned.)

    * The 'preferredTransport' specifies how to sort servers with respect to
    * transport protocols and may have the values (within IpProtocolSocketType):
    *    TCP
    *    UDP    (default value)
