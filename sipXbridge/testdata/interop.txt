Manual test cases.
-----------------


For each case you test, please preserve  /var/log/sipxpbx/  directory.
Please delete all contents of the directory ( clean traces ) between
tests.  Please restart sipxbridge for each test.


Note: You need a valid ITSP account configured to perform these tests.
"PSTN phone" is synonymous with your cell phone. Please use a second
cell number for hairpinned scenarios.

Scenarios are arranged here in increasing order of complexity:

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Scenario : Simple Inbound and Outbound calling with different models of
phones.  

Objective: To test interoperability for simple in and outbound calls
for different models of phones.

Procedure: Register phones with sipx and call inbound and
outbound. Inbound calls should be routed through auto attendant.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Scenario: Blind call transfer between sip phones. Inbound calling.

Objective: Test if blind transfer between different models of phones
works when phone calls are received from ITSP.  

Procedure: Connect two SIP phones to sipx.  Make an inbound call to sipx
using a PSTN phone to call in via the ITSP.  Transfer blind between  the
two SIP phones for the inbound call from ITSP.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Scenario: Blind call transfer between sip phones. Outbound calling.

Objective: Test if blind transfer between different models of phones
works when phone calls are placed to ITSP.  

Procedure: Connect two SIP phones to sipx.  Make an outbound call to
a PSTN phone number via the ITSP using a SIP phone.  Transfer blind to
the second phone for the outbound call via ITSP.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Scenario: Hairpinned Blind call transfer between PSTN phones. Inbound
calling.  

Objective: Test if blind transfer between ITSP works when phone calls
are received from a PSTN number via ITSP.

Procedure: Connect a SIP phone to sipx. Make an inbound call via the
ITSP. Transfer blind between phone and second PSTN number via the ITSP.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Scenario: Hairpinned Blind call transfer between PSTN phones. Outbound
calling.  

Objective: Test if blind transfer between PSTN works when phone calls
are initiated from SIP phone via ITSP.

Procedure: Connect a SIP phone to sipx. Make an outbound call. Transfer
blind between phone and second PSTN number via the ITSP.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Scenario: Attended transfer between SIP phones. Inbound calling.

Objective: Test if attended transfer between phones works when phone
calls are received from ITSP.  

Procedure: Connect two SIP phones to sipx. Transfer attended between the
two phones for inbound calls from ITSP.  Make sure the MOH is disabled
for the phone but enabled in sipxbridge. You should hear MOH during
the transfer.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Scenario: Attended transfer between SIP phones. Outbound calling.

Objective: Test if attended transfer between phones works when phone
calls are intiated from SIPX via ITSP.  

Procedure: Connect two SIP phones to sipx. Initiate an outbound call
to the PSTN via the ITSP from one of the phones.  Transfer attended
between the two phones for outbound calls to ITSP.  Make sure the MOH
is disabled for the phone but enabled in sipxbridge. You should hear
MOH on the phone that is on hold during the transfer.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Scenario: Attended hairpinned transfer between PSTN phones. Inbound
calling.  

Objective: Test if attended transfer between PSTN phones works
when phone calls are outbound from SIPX via ITSP.  

Procedure: Connect one SIP phone to sipx. Make an inbound call from a
PSTN number via the ITSP.  Transfer attended between phone and a second
PSTN number via the ITSP.  You should hear MOH during the transfer on
the first PSTN phone during the transfer.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Scenario: Attended hairpinned transfer between PSTN phones. Outbound calling.

Objective: Test if attended transfer between PSTN works when phone calls
are outbound from SIPX via ITSP.

Procedure: Connect one SIP phone to sipx. Make an outbound call to a
PSTN number via the ITSP.  Transfer attended between phone and a second
PSTN number via the ITSP.  Make sure the MOH is disabled for the phone
but enabled in sipxbridge. You should hear MOH during the transfer on
the first PSTN phone.
