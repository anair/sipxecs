/**
 * The XML RPC interface defining the Symmitron interfaces.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Calling conventions: <br/> Note that for interaction with C++ clients, we
 * will use the standard data type conventions. Following the normal mechanism
 * of XML-RPC. The data will be transmitted as bodies of HTTP requests and
 * responses and formatted in XML. See the following web page for data type
 * conversion from <a href="http://ws.apache.org/xmlrpc/types.html"> Java to XML
 * RPC </a>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Each request and response contains an instance-handle. When a controller
 * signs it, it specifies its non-unique name (such as "sipXproxy"), and a
 * unique instance handle (such as host name and process id). If the Symmitron
 * detects that this is a new instance of that controller (as the handle will be
 * different than before), then any resources currently controlled by the
 * previous instance will be reset and restored back to a known benign state.
 * This check is done on every interaction with the symmitron. This allows the
 * controllers to determine that the symmitron has rebooted and drop sessions
 * and similarly for the symmitron to detect that controllers rebooted and drop
 * sessions.
 * 
 * <p>
 * We use the following abstractions in the API below:
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li><it>SymEndpoint</it> This is an IP address and port. It represents
 * either a transmitter or a receiver.
 * <li><it>Sym</it> Is a container for a pair of <it>SymEndpoint</it> A Sym
 * has at most one transmitter and a receiver. A Sym transmits packets to the
 * remote end-point through its transmitter (if one exists) and receives packets
 * from the remote endpoint through the receiver.
 * 
 * <p>
 * A Sym has the following lifecycle: A sym is in the <b>INITAL</b> state when it is
 * first created. When a Sym is created, it includes a receiver but not a
 * transmitter. A transmitter has to be added through a separate operation. When
 * a transmitter is assigned to it, it transitions to the RUNNING state. When
 * the client wishes to hold transmission to the target of the transmitter, it
 * can pause the <it>Sym</it> at which point the Sym transitions to the PAUSED
 * state. A Sym in the PAUSED state does not forward data. The client can
 * <it>resume</it> transmission - transitioning the sym back to the <b>RUNNING</b>
 * state. The <it>Sym</it> can be destroyed - transitioning it to the
 * <b>TERMINATED</b> state and releasing all associated resources. Once a Sym is
 * in the <b>TERMINATED</b> state, it cannot transition out of that state.
 * 
 * <li><it>Bridge</it> a set of <it>Sym</it> A packet received on a Sym
 * belonging to a given Bridge is potentially transmitted via each of the other
 * Sym that belong to the Bridge. A given Sym can belong to only one Bridge.
 * 
 * <p>
 * A bridge has the following lifecycle: When a bridge is created, it contains
 * no Syms it is in the INITIAL state. A bridge may be <it>started</it> to
 * enable it to start forwarding packets. This places it in the <b>RUNNING</b>
 * state. A <b>RUNNING</b> bridge may be paused. When a bridge is in the
 * <b>PAUSED</b> state, data received from any of the Syms associated with the
 * Bridge is not forwarded. A bridge can be resumed from the <b>PAUSED</b>
 * state which puts it back into the <b>RUNNING</b> state. A bridge can be
 * destroyed which puts it into the <b>TERMINATED</b> state. A destroyed bridge
 * cannot transition out from the TERMINATED state. When a bridge is destroyed,
 * all of the associated Syms are also destroyed and their resources are
 * released.
 * 
 * </ul>
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * <p>
 * We use the java bean naming conventions to generate the key value pairs for
 * java objects. A Sym is represented by the following keys :
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li><it>id</it> -- the session Identifier.
 * <li><it>receiver</it> -- a hash map pointing to the receiver SymEndpoint
 * <li><it>transmitter</it> -- a hash map pointing to the transmitter
 * SymEndpoint.
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>
 * An SymEndpoint is represented by the following Hashmpap:
 * <ul>
 * <li><it>id</it> -- an unique to this endpoint.
 * <li><it>port</it> -- the Integer port where the SymEndpoint is receiving
 * messages or remote endpoint where the sym Endpoint is transmitting messages.
 * <li><it>ipAddress</it> -- the String IP Address where the sym Endpoint is
 * receiving or transmitting.
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>
 * We follow the convention of returning a status code with every response. The
 * status codes are simply Strings <b>ERROR</b> and <b>OK</b>. When returning
 * a Map, the status code is referenced by a String <it>status-code</it>.
 * Detailed failure cause is returned by referencing the key <it>faultInfo</it>.
 * In addition all Maps returned from the Symmitron will contain a special entry
 * called <it>instance-handle</it> that identifies the instance handle
 * corresponding to the current generation of Symmitron. We refer to this map as
 * the <it>standard map</it> in the API docs below.
 * 
 * <b> The following method Javadocs will only document the information in
 * addition to these standard keys. </b>
