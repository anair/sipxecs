//! Container for the state of a resource URI, shared by all the ResourceLists which contain that URI.
/** The (unimplemented) Resource object carries the state information
 *  regarding attempting to get state information from the resource.
 *  The code can be rearranged to use various strategies for getting
 *  the status of the URI.  The current version uses one ContactSet
 *  object which attempts to get the "reg" event package for the URI.
 *  If contacts are obtained via the "reg" event package, the
 *  ContactSet creates a SubscriptionSet object for each contact to
 *  obtain status from it.  If no contacts can be obtained, the
 *  ContactSet creates one SubscriptionSet to SUBSCRIBE to the
 *  resource URI itself.
 *
 *  This implementation splits the implementation of the
 *  (unimplemented) Resource object into two parts:  1) a
 *  ResourceReference object which is owned by the ResourceList
 *  object, and contains the information specific to the appearance of
 *  the Resource in the ResourceList (such as the <name> information),
 *  and 2) a ResourceCached object which is owned by the ResourceCache
 *  object, and contains the all the state information.  Each
 *  ResourceReference points to the ResourceCached which implements
 *  its Resource, and each ResourceCached has a list of all the
 *  ResourceReferences which point to it.
 *
 *  This split allows ResourceList's to share subscriptions to their
 *  target URIs.
