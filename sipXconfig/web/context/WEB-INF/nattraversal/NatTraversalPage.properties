quick.help=The NAT Traversal feature makes it possible to communicate with remote users and endpoints \
that are behind near-end and far-end NATs. In addition, it is possible to \
setup a multi-branch configuration over a public network using standard firewalls. <BR>\
The following configuration must be applied to the ffirewall at the network border: <p>\
* Relay UDP on port 5060 to the server's private IP address<BR> \
* Relay TCP on port 5060/5061 to the server's private IP address<BR> \
* Relay UDP ports allocated for media relay to the server's private IP address <p>\
Whenever it is detected that the two endpoints that are starting a media session are separated by \
one or more NATs, the server will insert its Media Relay into the media path. \
The NAT traversal feature supports full cone, restricted cone, port restricted cone as well as symmetric NATs.<p> \
In order to change the network topology (intranet domains and subnets) please visit the \
Internet Calling page.
