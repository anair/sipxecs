SipX REST Server
================

This is the RESTLET based server that implements a plugin mechanism
whereby REST services can be added seperately. The reason for inventing
this service is :
 - Consolidate port management.
 - A central place in the system where applications can access all 
   call control related REST services.
 - Consolidate access management.

The RESTLET based server application starts up a Jetty Server that will
listen in on a port designated for HTTP requests and another port for
HTTPS requests. 

Plugins are to be designed as RESTLET applications that implement a
defined interface (org.sipfoundry.sipxrest.Plugin) and are expected
to setup their route and parameters appropriately. These are installed
in the share/java/sipXrest/plugins  directory. They provide a service
descriptor to load the plugin.

By default, the service runs over HTTPS on port 6666 and over HTTP
with digest authentication on port 6667.

You can access https://domain:6666/ for a catalog of REST services 
that are supported by this server.
